# Luna-Nudo-And-Luna-Gusta---The-BNK-Group
Team BNK was assigned by the Clients to help them upgrade from their own home brand to the St Regis brand. The product improvement plan (PIP) had a clear strategy to upgrade the current premise to the intentional luxury hotel standard. This plan also meant upgrading their F &amp; B outlets. Luna Gusto was designed to be a high profile Jazz and performance bar in the evenings for international guests and corporate clients. By late night on weekends this would then transform into a high energy bar. To complement the penthouse party destination, an F &amp; B outlet curated on a European menu was to be introduced at the upper level which would merge and become part of the bar by night as a private party space. This space overlooked into the main bar below and yet had an identity of its own.  From suspended picture frames of European art to gold customised lights, leather panelling and customised lighting to luxury lounge furniture added to create this upmarket party and fine dine avenue.  Team BNK was actively part of the PIP and worked extensively with Gayatri Ruia (director of the Phoenix group) to help her create this stunning premise.
